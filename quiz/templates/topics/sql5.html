        <p>
            SQL transactions are sequences of SQL operations that are performed as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure data integrity by allowing multiple operations to be executed atomically. A transaction typically follows the ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
        </p>
        
        <h3>ACID Properties</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Atomicity:</strong> Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully or none of them are executed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after a transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Isolation:</strong> Ensures that the intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions until it is committed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Durability:</strong> Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive system failures.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Transaction Control Commands</h3>
        <p>
            SQL provides several commands to control transactions:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>START TRANSACTION:</strong> Begins a new transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>COMMIT:</strong> Saves the changes made during the current transaction to the database.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>ROLLBACK:</strong> Reverts the changes made during the current transaction and cancels the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>SAVEPOINT:</strong> Sets a named point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
            Consider a banking application where a transfer of funds between two accounts needs to be executed atomically. This can be achieved using transactions:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 123;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 456;
    COMMIT;
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            If any of the updates fail, the entire transaction will be rolled back, ensuring that the accounts remain in a consistent state.
        </p>
    </main>
