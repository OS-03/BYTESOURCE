    <h1>3.SQL Operators</h1> <!-- Fixed header -->
    <main>
        <hr>
        <p>
            SQL operators are symbols that allow you to perform operations on one or more operands to produce a result. These operators are used in SQL queries to manipulate data in databases.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Types of SQL Operators</h3>
        <p>
            There are several types of SQL operators, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and bitwise operators.
        </p>
        
        <h4>1. Arithmetic Operators</h4>
        <p>
            Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric operands. They include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
        </p>
        
        <h4>2. Comparison Operators</h4>
        <p>
            Comparison operators are used to compare values in SQL queries. They include equal to (=), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).
        </p>
        
        <h4>3. Logical Operators</h4>
        <p>
            Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in SQL queries. They include AND, OR, and NOT.
        </p>
        
        <h4>4. Bitwise Operators</h4>
        <p>
            Bitwise operators are used to perform operations at the bit level. They include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and bit shift operators (<< and >>).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of using SQL operators in queries:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Arithmetic Operator Example:</strong> SELECT salary * 1.1 AS increased_salary FROM employees;
            <br><br>
            <strong>Comparison Operator Example:</strong> SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100;
            <br><br>
            <strong>Logical Operator Example:</strong> SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 18 AND city = 'New York';
        </p>
