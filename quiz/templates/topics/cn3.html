        <h2>Network Protocols</h2>
        <p>
            Network protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network. They define the format, timing, sequencing, and error control mechanisms required for communication between devices in a network. Protocols enable devices from different manufacturers and running different operating systems to communicate with each other seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Network protocols operate at different layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe how different networking technologies interact. Each layer of the OSI model performs specific functions, and protocols at each layer provide services to the layer above it while using services from the layer below it.

        <h3>1. TCP/IP Protocol Suite</h3>
        <p>
            The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol suite is the foundation of the Internet and many other networks. It consists of a set of protocols that govern how data is transmitted over the Internet. TCP/IP protocols operate at the network and transport layers of the OSI model and include protocols such as IP (Internet Protocol), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), among others.
        </p>
        <h3>2. HTTP/HTTPS</h3>
        <p>
            HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are application-layer protocols used for transferring hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. HTTP defines how web browsers and servers communicate, allowing users to access web pages and navigate the web. HTTPS adds a layer of security by encrypting data exchanged between the browser and the server, ensuring privacy and integrity.
        </p>
        <h3>3. FTP/SFTP</h3>
        <p>
            FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) are application-layer protocols used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. FTP is widely used for uploading, downloading, and managing files on remote servers. SFTP, on the other hand, adds encryption to FTP, making file transfers more secure.
        </p>
        <h3>4. SMTP/POP3/IMAP</h3>
        <p>
            SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3), and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) are application-layer protocols used for email transmission and retrieval. SMTP is used to send emails from a client to a server or between servers. POP3 and IMAP are used by email clients to retrieve emails from a server. POP3 downloads emails to the client's device, while IMAP allows users to access emails stored on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are just a few examples of network protocols used in modern computer networks. Each protocol serves a specific purpose and operates at a specific layer of the OSI model. By adhering to standard protocols, devices from different vendors can communicate with each other reliably, enabling seamless data exchange and collaboration over networks.
